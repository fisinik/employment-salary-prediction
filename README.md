## About

- <strong>University: </strong>University of Prishtina
- <strong>Faculty: </strong>Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering
- <strong>Study Program: </strong>Master of Computer and Software Engineering
- <strong>Subject (1st year): </strong>Machine Learning taught by [Prof. Dr. Eng. Lule Ahmedi](https://staff.uni-pr.edu/profile/luleahmedi) and [PhD. c MÃ«rgim Hoti](https://staff.uni-pr.edu/profile/m%C3%ABrgimhoti)

The goal of this [project](https://github.com/fisinik/employment-salary-prediction) is to predict the male/female employment salary based on the data provided by [Tax Administration of Kosovo](https://www.atk-ks.org/en/open-data/). This project is used for the Machine Learning course in University of Prishtina, Computer and Software Engineering.

## Phase 1 (Preparing the model)

### Dataset overview

  Number of Taxpayers" <strong>(numerical discrete)</strong>
- "Nr Puns
  Broj zaposlenih
  Number of employees" <strong>(numerical discrete)</strong>
- Primar Primarna Primary <strong>(numerical discrete)</strong>
- Sekondar Sekundarna Secondary <strong>(numerical discrete)</strong>
- "Meshkuj
  Muskarci
  Men (M)." <strong>(numerical discrete)</strong>
- "Femra
  Zenske
  Women (F)" <strong>(numerical discrete)</strong>
- "Pa Verif

- F 45-54 <strong>(numerical discrete)</strong>
- M 55-64 <strong>(numerical discrete)</strong>
- F 55-64 <strong>(numerical discrete)</strong>
- M 65+ <strong>(numerical discrete)</strong>
- F 65+ <strong>(numerical discrete)</strong>
- "Mesat. Pages
  Prosecna plata
  Average Wage" <strong>(numerical continuous)</strong>
- "Mesat. Meshk
  Prosecni M.
  Average M." <strong>(numerical continuous)</strong>
- "Mesat. Fem.
  Prosecni F. Average F." <strong>(numerical continuous)</strong>

#### Data integration

Our dataset is separated based on years of employment data on 5 CSV (Comma Separated Values) files. The files can be found on the link provided on the about section. Using pandas python package we have read and concatinated the 5 csv files into one dataframe "employment_combined".

#### Dataset Size

The resulting dataframe consists of <strong>88014 rows</strong> spaned through 5 years divided into <strong>27 attributes</strong> as described above.

#### Null values

### Dimension reduction and agreggation

Since the attributes are described in three languages, for simplicity's sake we have changed the column names to the corresponding English representation.

Noticing how columns "Men" and "Women" don't have an accurate summary of the age group columns, we have dropped the Men, Women columns and have added the accurate summaries from the age group columns.

Furthermore, columns such as Number of Taxpayers, Primary, Secondary, Unverified, Average wage, have been removed in the context of our objectives stated in the about section.

After these modifications our dataframe consists of the following columns:

- Year <strong>(categorical ordinal)</strong>
- Month <strong>(categorical ordinal)</strong>
- Month-Year <strong>(categorical ordinal)</strong>
- Sector Description <strong>(categorical nominal)</strong>
- Registration Status <strong>(categorical nominal)</strong>
- Municipality <strong>(categorical nominal)</strong>
- Number of Employees <strong>(numerical discrete)</strong>
- Men <strong>(numerical discrete)</strong>
- Women <strong>(numerical discrete)</strong>
- Average Wage Men <strong>(numerical continuous)</strong>
- Average Wage Women <strong>(numerical continuous)</strong>

### Data cleaning

By default values in columns "Average Wage Men" and "Average Wage Women" are NaN if there isn't a male/female employee in that instance. Therefore we fill these columns where values are missing with zeros only if the corresponding Men/Women column has zero value also.

After cleaning these columns our dataset consists of <strong>70611 cleaned rows</strong>.

### Discretization of "Registration Status" and "Sector Description"

As seen on the preprocessing file, we notice that column "Registration Status" has <strong>30 unique string values</strong> whereas 'Sector Description' has <strong>22 unique string values</strong>. We have created two new columns "Registration Id" and "Sector Id" to apply discretization of these columns.
